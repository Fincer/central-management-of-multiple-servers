README
==============

**NOTE:** For the meantime, this repository is written in finnish. I may translate it to english, depending on my time schedule.

- This repository is mainly for my personal school work in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences related to central management of multiple servers (master/slave model), focusing mainly on Linux environment. It includes exercises which follow file name syntax h1.md h2.md .. (h = harjoitus = meaning "exercise" in finnish language).

- Texts in the exercices are written in finnish as the task definitions are presented in finnish on the course these exercices have been done for.
